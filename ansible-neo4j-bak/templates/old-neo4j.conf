# If Neo4j is running on a dedicated server, then it is generally recommended

# SSL system configuration
#*****************************************************************

# Names of the SSL policies to be used for the respective components.

# The legacy policy is a special policy which is not defined in
# the policy configuration section, but rather derives from
# dbms.directories.certificates and associated files
# (by default: neo4j.key and neo4j.cert). Its use will be deprecated.

# The policies to be used for connectors.
#
# N.B: Note that a connector must be configured to support/require
#      SSL/TLS for the policy to actually be utilized.
#
# see: dbms.connector.*.tls_level

#bolt.ssl_policy=legacy
#https.ssl_policy=legacy

#*****************************************************************
# SSL policy configuration
#*****************************************************************

# Each policy is configured under a separate namespace, e.g.
#    dbms.ssl.policy.<policyname>.*
#
# The example settings below are for a new policy named 'default'.

# The base directory for cryptographic objects. Each policy will by
# default look for its associated objects (keys, certificates, ...)
# under the base directory.
#
# Every such setting can be overriden using a full path to
# the respective object, but every policy will by default look
# for cryptographic objects in its base location.
#
# Mandatory setting

#dbms.ssl.policy.default.base_directory=certificates/default

# Allows the generation of a fresh private key and a self-signed
# certificate if none are found in the expected locations. It is
# recommended to turn this off again after keys have been generated.
#
# Keys should in general be generated and distributed offline
# by a trusted certificate authority (CA) and not by utilizing
# this mode.

#dbms.ssl.policy.default.allow_key_generation=false

# Enabling this makes it so that this policy ignores the contents
# of the trusted_dir and simply resorts to trusting everything.
#
# Use of this mode is discouraged. It would offer encryption but no security.

#dbms.ssl.policy.default.trust_all=false

# The private key for the default SSL policy. By default a file
# named private.key is expected under the base directory of the policy.
# It is mandatory that a key can be found or generated.

#dbms.ssl.policy.default.private_key=

# The private key for the default SSL policy. By default a file
# named public.crt is expected under the base directory of the policy.
# It is mandatory that a certificate can be found or generated.

#dbms.ssl.policy.default.public_certificate=

# The certificates of trusted parties. By default a directory named
# 'trusted' is expected under the base directory of the policy. It is
# mandatory to create the directory so that it exists, because it cannot
# be auto-created (for security purposes).
#
# To enforce client authentication client_auth must be set to 'require'!

#dbms.ssl.policy.default.trusted_dir=

# Client authentication setting. Values: none, optional, require
# The default is to require client authentication.
#
# Servers are always authenticated unless explicitly overridden
# using the trust_all setting. In a mutual authentication setup this
# should be kept at the default of require and trusted certificates
# must be installed in the trusted_dir.

#dbms.ssl.policy.default.client_auth=require

# A comma-separated list of allowed TLS versions.
# By default TLSv1, TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 are allowed.

#dbms.ssl.policy.default.tls_versions=

# A comma-separated list of allowed ciphers.
# The default ciphers are the defaults of the JVM platform.
